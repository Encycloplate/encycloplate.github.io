# What is the Encycloplate?
The Encycloplate is a completely free template, a base for indie, authoritative non-wiki online encyclopedias about anything, with built-in useful javascript functions such as its own, custom, easy to use markup language with an automatic parser to html, an automatic, hassle-free ToC (Table of Contents) maker, a subtitle popup function, working random page button, modern CSS and more! You don't need to be an expert in coding, styling, formatting and SEO to make your encyclopedia anymore.

# How to use it?
To use it to make your own project it is really simple, and basically you just need to fork it or download the files, customise the branding, style, and add your pages. Here is a list of steps you need to make:

1. Fork this repository or download the files
2. Download the Python 3.11.9 or newer at the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Customise the branding to your own, and optionally, the styles
4. Write your article in an .skt markup language file in proper §Text formatting
5. Execute the silkrowparser.py and select the input .skt file path and the output .html path
6. Add the name of your new article in random.js under the js folder
7. Credit me and this repository in a visible part of your website :)
8. Make a new GitHub repository following the [Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/) and dump the files and folders there
9. It should automatically deploy your website to the internet
